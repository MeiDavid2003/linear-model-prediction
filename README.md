# linear model prediction
 The dataset provided is a Census dataset by county ID, covering the entire United States. It is sourced from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates, with the full dataset available on the American FactFinder website. The data includes both count variables (e.g., Men: the number of men in a county) and percentage-based variables (e.g., Hispanic: the percentage of the population that is Hispanic/Latino). My task is to develop linear regression models to predict Y1: Median household income in the county and Y2: Unemployment rate in the county.
